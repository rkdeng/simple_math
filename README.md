# simple_math
 A simple math pygame for my boy.  
 Rescue the cat from the poop alien by answering math questions. :)  
 Right now, the questions are only addition and subtraction. You can change them to other types of questions in the code. Developed in python 3.6.8 and pygame 1.9.6.

 Acknowledgments: Some codes were learned from TechWithTim's pygame tutorial (https://techwithtim.net/). Huge thanks to him for making great tutorials! The cat pictures are from 小刘鸭_刘阿圆 (lwj1005@qq.com, if you are mad at me for using your art, please contact me. I will take them down...). Other pictures are from google... In memory of 2020, as such a special year, I added a mask to the cat.
